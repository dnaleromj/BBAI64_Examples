# BBAI64_Examples

This repo is intended to capture what I learn about the TDA4VM / Beaglebone AI-64.   

1. Working simple examples of using the PRUs
  a. How to compile assembly, C, like and
  b. Deploy, start, stop
  c. Determine which GPI/GPO pins are dedicated to the PRU cores
  d. MCU to PRU communications (what methods, pro con)
  e. PRU GPIO control (led, rgb led, stepper etc)
2. Working simple examples of the R5F cores in the main 
  a. How to compile assembly, C, like and

What is the R5F good for?
What is the PRU good for?

How does the machinekit stepgen and other components work for the PRU (MCU
Same for klipper
